"Note:  From original FAIR Python code, ""'Indirect' forcings can be specified by adding species with the syntax 'x|y': this means the gas cycle of species 'x' is used to compute an additional forcing based on the f parameters specified. 'y' designates the name of the indirect forcing, such as 'methane|strat_h2o'.""",,,,,
